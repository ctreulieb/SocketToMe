myTCP

	SOCKET h;

TCP
	bind * Server
	listen * Server
	accept * uses own socket
	connect + needs unconnected socket 
	myTcp serv1.connect(addr, port)
	{	
		
	}
	send - needs socket
	recv - needs socket
UDP
	bind *
	sendto - use your own socket
		needs address and char*
	recvfrom - use your own socket
	
TCPConnection contains a SOCKET.

Does it need a destructor then, to close the socket when we're done?

44 byte leak in VS2012 multi-threaded app - prob fine.
